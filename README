port70 - a Gopher server (RFC-1436) written in Lua.  This currently runs my
own personal Gopher server at <gopher://gopher.conman.org/> but should be
usable by people other than myself, unlike my previous Gopher server.

Features:

* Configurable filenames for Gopher index files.
* A much nicer Gopher index file format native to this program.
* Generates Gopher indexes for directories that lack a Gopher index file.
* Support for user directories.
* Support for URL: selectors.
* Easily extensible with support for custom handlers.
* Experiemental support for selector redirection.
* Configuration via file.

Prerequisites:

* Lua 5.3 or higher
* GNU libmagic (NOTE:  this is NOT image manipulation, but file
  identification)
* LPEG 1.0.0 or higher
* A whole bunch of other Lua modules, available at:
	* https://github.com/spc476/lua-conmanorg
	* https://github.com/spc476/LPeg-Parsers

Installation:

This will require some work.  You will need to download the modules listed
above from Github and get them installed.  The lua-conmanorg repository will
take some futzing around to get it compiled (first hint:  remove any mention
of tcc in the Makefile).  But once you have all the prerequisites installed,
the server should just work.  

Bulding:

Just type "make" (there's one C module that might be required, depending
upon your desired configuration).  If you have the Lua include files in a
non-standard location, you may need to do:

	make LUA_INCDIR=/path/to/Lua/includes

or even

	make LUA=<luaexec> LUA_INCDIR=/path/to/Lua/includes

You can do "make install" if you want to install the server onto the system:

	make install

This will install files in the following locations:

	/usr/local/bin/port70		 # server
	/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/port70/	 # server modules (written in C)
	/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/port70/ # server modules (written in Lua)

To fine tune, you can from the command line:

	make [location] install

The various [location] options are (multiple can be specified)

	prefix=target-dir

		target-dir/bin/port70
		target-dir/lib/lua/5.3/port70/
		target-dir/share/lua/5.3/port70/

	LUADIR=target-dir

		target-dir/port70/	# modules written in Lua

	LIBDIR=target-dir

		target-dir/port70/	# modules written in C

	BINDIR=target-dir

		target-dir/port70/	# server program

Configuration:

The file "minimal-conf.lua" is the bare minimum configuration file you'll
need to serve up files from a directory, but do look at the sample-conf.lua
file as that has extensive comments about each section and what is required,
and what isn't.  It will help to know some Lua, especially Lua string
patterns (its form of regex) as various sections of the configuration are
applied to requests via pattern matching of the request.
