CAPS
# These four characters must be at the beginning to identify the file
# as successfully fetched.

# This is a caps file. This contains a list of key=value pairs that are
# useful to clients wishing to query the server for special information
# without using extensions such as Gopher+. Not all clients support caps
# queries, so your site should be navigable without it. This is an
# optional feature and is not currently a Gopher protocol standard.
# Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Clients should cache the information where possible.
# Some servers may automatically generate caps files for you as a pseudo
# selector. In that case, this file may serve only to supersede the
# machine-generated keys. You should read your server documentation.
#
# All keys are optional. Not all keys listed here need be specified, and
# in fact many sites won't specify all of them. The client should be
# prepared to deal with that too.

### CAPS META PROPERTIES ###
#
# Spec version of this caps file. This should be the first key specified
# so that an incompatible later format might be detected by the client.
CapsVersion=1

# This tells the client the recommended caps cache expiry time, in seconds.
# This particular property tells the client to refetch the caps file after
# an hour has passed, preferentially. This is optional for the client to
# implement.
ExpireCapsAfter=3600

### PATH SECTION. USE THESE DEFAULT VALUES IF YOU ARE ON A POSIX FILESYSTEM ###

# This tells the client how to cut up a selector into a breadcrumb menu.
# This is a simple ASCII string. If it is not specified, the selector is
# treated as if it were opaque. The client may collapse consecutive
# delimiters (e.g., x//y is treated as x/y) except if PathParentDouble is
# true (for Mac).
#PathDelimeter=/

# This tells the client what the "identity" path is, i.e., it can treat
# this as a no-op, turning x/./y into x/y. If this is not specified, the
# literal path . is used.
#PathIdentity=.

# This tells the client what the parent path is, i.e., it can treat this
# as a path instruction to delete previous path, turning x/y/../z into x/z
# If this is not specified, the literal path .. is used.
#PathParent=..

# This tells the client that consecutive path delimeters are treated as
# parent (mostly for Mac HFS prior to Mac OS X), e.g., turning
# MacHD:x:y:::z into MacHD:z. If this is not specified, it is default FALSE.
PathParentDouble=FALSE

# This tells the client the escape character for quoting the above
# metacharacters. Most of the time this is \. If this is not specified,
# no escape characters are used.
#PathEscapeCharacter=\

# This tells the client not to cut everything up to the first path delimeter.
# Normally caps makes gopher://x/11/xyz into /xyz as well as gopher://x/1/xyz, 
# assuming your server is happy with the latter URL (almost all will be).
# If this is not specified, it is by default FALSE. This should be TRUE
# *only* if your server requires URLs like gopher://x/0xyz.
PathKeepPreDelimeter=TRUE

# Some clients will or may make use of these; some won't.
