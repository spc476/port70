This is my own server on the Internet.  The base operating system is Linux,
and on it, I run the following services:

	HTTP	http://www.conman.org/
	GOPHER	gopher://gopher.conman.org/
	SMTP	sean@conman.org
	DNS
	QOTD

I feel strongly about running my own infrastructure and maintaining control
over my own digital data.
