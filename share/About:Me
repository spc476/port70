I'm a programmer, although I have several interests that I will delve into
from time to time.  Other jobs in the past have included:

* Cinematographer for a film that never got made
* Newspaper photographer
* Humor columnist [1]
* System administrator
* Network administrator
* Quality assurance engineer

I recall when both the web and gopher started, but never did get around to
running a gopher site until a few years ago [2].  Most of the content I've
developed has been for the web [3] but I'm moving bits and peices to my
gopher server [4].
